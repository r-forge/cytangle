Description: The method of topolgical data analysis uses persistent homology
  to discover intersting toplogical structurs (includig loops and voids)
  from "point cloud" data sets. One of the statistical challenges is to
  distinguish transient noise from long-lasting biologically meaningful
  structure. EBGLIDE provides tools to help solve this problem.
