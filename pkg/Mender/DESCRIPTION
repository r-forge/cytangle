Title: Visualizing Topological Loops and Voids
Author: Kevin R. Coombes, Jake Reed
Maintainer: Kevin R. Coombes <krc@silicovore.com>
Description: Visualizations to explain the results of a topological
  data analysis (TDA). The goal of TDA is to identify persistent
  topological structures, such as loops (topological circles) and
  voids (topological spheres), in data sets. The output of an analysis
  using the TDA package in R is a "Rips diagram" (named after the
  mathematician  Elihuya Rips). The goal of Mender is to "repair" these
  holes or "rips" in the data by providing tools to visualize the
  features that help explain the structures found in the Rips
  diagram.
