Description: Visualizations to explain the results of a topological
  data analysis. The goal of topological data analysis is to identify
  persistent topological structures, such as loops (topological circles)
  and voids (topological spheres), in data sets. The output of an
  analysis using the 'TDA' package is a Rips diagram (named after the
  mathematician Eliyahu Rips). The goal of 'RPointCloud' is to fill in
  these holes in the data by providing tools to visualize the features
  that help explain the structures found in the Rips diagram. See McGee
  and colleagues (2024) <doi:10.1101/2024.05.16.593927>.
